# iTunes Search Application

## Description

This is a web app that lets users search for media on the iTunes Store. It is a full-stack project showcasing React on the front end and a secure Node.js backend. The app is designed to be both user-friendly and secure, making it a great example of a modern, professional-grade web application.

## Purpose

The app demonstrates how to:

-   Secure API requests using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
-   Build a responsive and interactive React front end for searching and managing data.
-   Handle user interactions, state management, and dynamic data rendering effectively.

## Key Features

-   **Search Functionality:** Users can search the iTunes Store for music, movies, podcasts, and more by entering a search term and selecting a media type.
-   **Secure Requests:** The backend uses JWT to secure API requests after the first search, ensuring a safe user experience.
-   **Favorites Management:** Users can save their favorite items, view them on a dedicated page, and remove them as needed.
-   **Interactive UI:** The React front end dynamically displays search results and updates the favorites list in real-time.
-   **Responsive Design:** The app works well on both desktop and mobile devices, with a clean and modern interface.

## How to Install and Run Locally

### Requirements

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   npm (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Set up the backend:
    - Go to the backend folder:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    - Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
3. Set up the frontend:
    - Go to the frontend folder:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    - Start the frontend app:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Technologies Used

-   **Backend:**
    -   Node.js
    -   Express.js
    -   JWT for secure API authorization
-   **Frontend:**
    -   React.js
    -   Axios for API calls
-   **Styling:**
    -   Custom CSS for a polished, responsive design

## Why This Project Stands Out

-   **Portfolio:** I made this project as a demonstration of my web development skills, showcasing external API calls, dynamic web design, jwt authorisation and securing apis, as well as RESTful Api design.
-   **Reusable Code:** The JWT middleware and secure API flow are modular and can be adapted for other applications.
-   **Clean, Scalable Design:** The app uses best practices in React for state and component management, making it easy to extend.
-   **Other projects::** If you are interested, have a look at my other projects showcasing use of a more advanced React.js project - shop design of a eCommerce website (ReactMart), my toDoList with advanced JWT user authorisation using React.js/Express.js, or my car dataBase with MongoDb and React.js/Express.js.

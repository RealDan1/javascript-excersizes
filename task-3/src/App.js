          React (and other frameworks/libraries) make coding less tedious than
          using vanilla JS because it is declarative. It lets you say what you
          want the UI to look like and then react handles the how to do it
          part.writing vanilla JS as a beginner would normally take much more
          work.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can create buttons, forms, or sections as components and use them
          again and again without rewriting the same code.
        </li>
        <li>
          React lets you split your UI into small, reusable pieces called
          components, so you donâ€™t have to write everything in one big file.
          This makes it easier to maintain and update the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Frameworks and libraries provide preset and template methods for
          workflow so you can focus less on the code and more on what you want
          the end design to look like.
        </li>
        <li>
          React for example has effective ways of managing the state of a
          website, so you can make pages dynamic more easily than if you where
          to use vanilla JS.
        </li>

        <li>
          Frameworks and Libraries make it easier to handle manage large scale
          projects. it allows modular collaboration and updating of the code.

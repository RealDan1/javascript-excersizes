# ReactMart

## Description

ReactMart is a full-featured eCommerce application showcasing dynamic product management, user authentication, and a responsive shopping experience. Users can browse products, track their total spending across tabs, and perform secure registration and login. The app combines React with Bootstrap for a clean, interactive, and mobile-friendly design.

## Purpose

The app demonstrates how to:

-   Implement dynamic state management using React's `useState` and component-based architecture.
-   Utilize React Router for seamless multi-page navigation.
-   Validate user input with Formik for secure registration and login forms.
-   Style applications with Bootstrap for a professional and responsive UI.
-   Dynamically track and update data across components, such as the total cart price.

## Key Features

-   **Dynamic Product Management:** Users can browse, select, and buy products with options for different colors.
-   **Persistent Price Tracker:** The total price of selected items is dynamically calculated and displayed across pages.
-   **User Authentication:** Includes secure registration and login with field validation.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS for an optimized user experience on any device.
-   **Interactive Navigation:** React Router provides smooth and efficient page transitions.
